### Education and Professional Experience
Hello! I am currently in the GIS Certificate program at MSU Denver. I am also a [ESIIL](https://esiil.org) intern for 2024! I have a bachelor’s in physics and energy science. I work for an engineering consulting firm testing asphalt, concrete, and soil. Being in the construction industry had made me realize there is more to fixing potholes than just patching them up. It’s like having a new set of eyes to see all the details within our roads. 


### Interest in Earth Data Science
While living in Colorado Springs, I was able to hear many stories about how the Waldo Canyon fire impacted the community. In my geology courses at UCCS I performed hydrophobicity testing on the soil within the burn area. Even after 10 years, the soil remains hydrophobic. I am interested in using Earth Data Science to explore the effect of wildfires and solutions to revitalizing vegetation within the burn scars.
