## Rachel Sadler

Hello! I am currently a student at MSU Denver. I am currently working toward earning a GIS certificate. I am a [ESIIL](https://esiil.org) intern for 2024. I have a Bachelor's degree in Physics and Energy Science from UCCS. Currently, I work for a engineering consulting firm testing asphalt, concrete, and soil. I love exploring the Denver Metro area and going to concerts. I play tennis and am taking hiphop dance classes.
